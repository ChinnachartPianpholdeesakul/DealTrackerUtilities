# This file is the IPC Routing information file (ipcroute)
#
# An ipcroute file is used to route:
# 1. a SSL sink application to a Sink Distributor
# 2. a SSL source application to a Source Database Manager
# 3. a Source Database Manager to a Source Distributor
#
# An ipcroute file may also have an optional parameter. This parameter
# specifies how long times outs are in seconds for mounts. the two time
# outs deal with the completion of establishment of an IPC channel and
# the round trip time of a MOUNT request and an ACK or NAK.
# These two events are timed separately. But they may use the same time-out.
#
# The parameter lines is as follows (uncomment the line to activate it)
# mount_wait_time = 10
# mount_wait_time is the name of the parameter 
# 10 is the number of seconds to wait.
#
# The default value to complete an IPC channel is 10 seconds
# The IPC will any value supplied that is > 0
#
# The default value for a snk_mount() is 20. The snk_mount() call will
# use the maximum of the parameter or 20.
#
# The default value for a src_mount is 90 (due to extra potential processing
# by the srcdbms). The src_mount() call will use the maximum of the parameter
# or 90.
#
#
# SSL Inter-Process Communication is based upon a client/server model.
# In case 1 above, the sink application is the client and the Sink Distributor
# is the server. In case 2, the source application is the client and the
# Source Database Manager is the server. In case 3, the Source Database
# Manager is the client and the Source Distributor is the server.
#
# The format of a routing entry is:
#
# <service_name>.<client_type> : <client_host> : <server_host>
#
# where:
#  <service_name>
#       is the logical service name of the particular server (i.e., the Sink
#       Distributor, Source Database Manager, or Source Distributor) to which
#       the routing entry pertains:
#       (1) A Sink Distributor is always started as service name 'triarch_sink'.
#       Therefore, this service name must be either 'triarch_sink' or an alias
#       equivalent to 'triarch_sink'.
#       (2) The service name of a Source Database Manager is defined by the
#       DB_SERVER_NAME parameter in the srcdbms.config file. The default name
#       is triarch_dbms.
#       (3) The service name of the Source Distributor is defined by the
#       DIST_IPC_DESC parameter in the srcdbms.config file. The Source
#       Distributor is always started as service name 'triarch_src'. Therefore,
#       this service name must be either 'triarch_src' or an alias equivalent 
#       to 'triarch_src'.
#
#  <client_type>
#       is 'sinklib' for all SSL sink applications.
#       is 'srclib' for both a Source Database Manager and a Source Distributor.
#
#  <client_host>
#       is the hostname on which the client (i.e., the sink application, source
#       application, or Source Database Manager) is running.
#
#  <server_host>
#       is a list of hostnames on which the server (i.e., the Sink Distributor,
#       Source Database Manager, or Source Distributor) is running.
#       More than one server host may be specified for alternate routing at
#       mount time. The client will attempt to mount to these machines in the
#       order in which they are listed (left to right).
